# RAML-to-Swagger-Converter

## About the project
This repository contains a java project that converts RAML v0.8 API definition to Swagger v2.0 definition. It contains
a standalone application for such conversion and also support using the converter as a library within your project.
For more info on swagger definitions, [Click here](https://swagger.io/docs/). For RAML docs, [Click here](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-08/raml-08.md)

## Steps to run the utility
* Download and install Apache Maven (https://maven.apache.org)
* In the project directory issue `mvn package` which will build the application in the `raml2swagger-app/target` folder
* Run the application with `java - jar target/raml2swagger-{version}-jar-with-dependencies.jar <input file>` 
* An example is provided in the example directory which will convert jukebox-api.raml (RAML 0.8) to jukebox-api.json (Swagger 2.0).

## Steps to use the project as a library
* Download and install Apache Maven (https://maven.apache.org)
* In the project directory issue `mvn install` which will build the application and library
* Add the dependency into your POM or use the built library in your project. The library JAR is in `raml2swagger-lib/target`.

## Todos
* This project currently supports only conversion of RAML v0.8 (RAML 1.0 parser library is not yet available for java as of now). The support for RAML 1.0 conversion to Swagger 2.0 has to be made once RAML 1.0 parser is available.
* Almost all the edge cases (rarely used definition fields in API definition) are taken care of. But incase something is missed out, please raise an issue.

## Footnotes
* Incase you find any bugs or want to add any new feature that's included in the Swagger definition (say, in the future), then you are highly welcome to contribute to the project.
